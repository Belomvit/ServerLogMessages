Client-server application that follows the next algorithm:
  1. Server keeps ports 8000 and 8001 open.
  2. Each client generates a unique identifier for itself.
  3. Client connects to server port 8000, provides its unique identifier and gets a unique code
  from the server.
  4. Client connects to server port 8001, provides a text message, its identifier and code that
  it received on step 2.
  5. If client code does not match client identifier, server returns an error to the client.
  6. If client code is correct, server writes the provided text message to a log file.
  Server should be able to simultaneously work with at least 50 clients.
